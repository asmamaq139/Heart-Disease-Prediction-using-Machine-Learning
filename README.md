# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning algorithms i.e. Logistic regression, KNN and SVM used to predict heart disease in patients 

- Logistic regression 
- KNN is trained with 25 neighbors and then accuracy rate checked for each number of neighbors then we pick n= 22 which provides best accuracy rate.
- GridSearchCV method used to tune hyper-parameters of SVM model
